Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G.

### Papers for GANs:

1. GANs are an interesting idea that were first introduced in 2014 by a group of researchers at the University of Montreal lead by Ian Goodfellow.

Goodfellow, Ian, et al. "[Generative adversarial nets](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf)." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2014.


2. Here's a list of what started as a fun activity compiling all named GANs: 
The [GAN Zoo](https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo) from Github
